## A common interface that represents a list of files that can be read.

   Various types (e.g. Vector, Column) can convert to this type to be able to be
   used in `Data.read_many`.
type Many_Files_List
    ## PRIVATE
       Arguments:
       - original_value: The original value that represents a list of files.
         Some return modes may use it as it contains more information than just
         list of files (e.g. it can be a source table).
       - paths_to_load: A vector of paths to load. This is the fallback that can
         be used by any return mode if it does not recognize the original value.
         The vector is expected to contain values that can be passed into
         `Data.read` (so it can be Text, File, URI or any other kind of file -
         e.g. S3_File).
